    <h1 class="history-header">History of Bharat Coking Coal Limited (BCCL)</h1>
    <div class="history-content">
        <p>
            Bharat Coking Coal Limited (BCCL) was incorporated in January 1972 as a Public Sector Undertaking to operate coking coal mines in the Jharia and Raniganj Coalfields, which were taken over by the Government of India on 16th October 1971. The objective was to ensure the planned development of the scarce coking coal resources in the country, which are vital for the steel sector and other core industries.
        </p>
        <div class="history-subheader">Background</div>
        <p>
            Prior to nationalization, most of the coking coal mines in the Jharia and Raniganj coalfields were operated by private owners. The unscientific mining practices, lack of investment in technology, and poor safety standards led to wastage of coal, frequent accidents, and environmental degradation. The Government of India, recognizing the strategic importance of coking coal for the steel industry, decided to nationalize these mines.
